#integers can hold positive and negative numbers but they have to be full numbers
#a float is a decimal number
#assignment opperator is a = sign or
#you can add
#you can also subtract
#you can also devide
#you can also multiply They just all have to be the same time everytime
#for homework she wants us to write out the equation so they see it and also the results

#if you set it up once you never have to do it again
